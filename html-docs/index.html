  <h3>About me:</h3>

  <p>I'm from Aspen, CO.  I enjoy mountain biking and skiing.  I really love music.
    I listen to a little bit of everything, and I love finding new artists and albums
    from others.  I have a cat named Bean, she's fairly cool, except for when she goes
    bonkers at 2am.  She also likes to gnaw on flip-flops.  I have two younger
    sisters who mean a lot to me.</p>
